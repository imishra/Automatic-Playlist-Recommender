# Automatic-Playlist-Recommender

This application is aimed to provide playlist recommendations to the users based on their listening behaviour and interest. This application has two components 'APRSystem' which and 'APRWebApplication'.

### APRSystem:
This is the recommendation engine which created the playlist recommendation based on the song similrity in terms of users behaviour and exposes a REST API to the java web application to request recommendations.

### APRWebApplication:
This is the Web application that users interact with to get playlist suggestions.

This application had few limitions which we have considered has future scorope such as adding it to songs and music website which can allow users to listen to the suggested playlist instead of just recieving teh recommendations. Please go through the documentation for further details.
